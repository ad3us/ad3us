<h2 id="python-to-go-programming-language">Python: To-go Programming Language</h2> <p>Recently i started to learn the Python programming language. You might say:&ldquo;Ah, shit! Here we go again.&rdquo;, but listen! Yes, it is annoying that everyone and everybody screams and yells that it is slow and unflexible language&hellip; but! It&rsquo;s still the best language for the beginners. Some of my friends recommended me to start with C, because it&rsquo;s the primary language for CS, and i tried to learn it&hellip; But, unfortunately i quit. I tried finding something easier for the beginning, and it was Python.</p>
<h2 id="coolest-courses-ever">Coolest courses ever!</h2> <p>So, as a beginner, i started to find some info to learn python most effective way possible. Found some books, websites, courses, etc&hellip; but none of them was effective as the course in the <a href="boot.dev">Boot.dev</a> called &ldquo;Learn to code in Python&rdquo;. It was very interesting journey for me and to these days, I am still using this website to learn stuff. Very interactive, fun and free! Well, not fully free. Free plan excludes interactivity, learning progress, but, still, you can see the all lessons and using you local IDE to learn some stuff.</p>
<h2 id="solve-some-katas-">Solve some katas :)</h2> <p>The second useful service is <a href="codewars.com">Codewars</a>. In this website you can solve some problems by their difficulty and earn some progress. There is a scoreboard with the strongest mfs in this service and also, you can challenge them. It&rsquo;s like a duel. Cool isn&rsquo;t it? And it&rsquo;s free!</p>
<p>I hope you will check them both because those services are amazing.</p>
<p>See ya!</p>
